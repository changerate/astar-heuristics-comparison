Working with custom priority queue of tuples: (f(n), node)
fixing the error where i'm getting: [7, (6, node)]

heuristic goes to zero (manhattan distance). 
path cost (or number of moves in our case) increases.


there should be a set for the following: 
1. The explored set -- cost is the summed manhattan distance 
2. The frontier 


The priority queue of things to move 

(0, '3')
(0, '4')
(0, '6')
(0, '7')
(1, '1')
(1, '8')
(1, '5')
(1, '2')
(4, '0')
